====version-2====
====NICE2TODO====
[  ] - for every package create a 'go_info' file with all necesiary informations (or statistics) about the devel subpackage and project (like a history)
[  ] - add time measurement to all commands, optimize what can be optimized
[  ] - measure computation time of scripts used in cron job[s] and optimize them
[  ] - add --dry option to all commands
[  ] - write a tool to generate Godeps.json file (but how to detect) {https://github.com/jingweno/nut}
[  ] - write a script to check for ownership of golang directories (to have an overview)
[  ] - for each scan make a temp file that holds all items that were already succesefully checked (in case of a failed check, check only those that did not pass)
[  ] - statistics of number of golang commits/builds/updates/overrides per day (from koji, updates, ...)

====TODO===
[  ] - read pkgdb in parallel via threads
[  ] - when searching for new golang packages, repoquery those which depends on golang devel packages
[  ] - write a script to update all local golang packages to the latest built
[  ] - after gofed created -c test if some lines were removed and ask for confirmation (add -y option as yes for all) 
[  ] - write a script to detect if all packages are up to date, use https://api.github.com/repos/<repo>/<project>/commits, e.g. https://api.github.com/repos/spf13/hugo/commits
[  ] - run a scan of all packages to check if they are up2date with upstream or not
[  ] - check koji for overrides: koji latest-build does not always returns the latest rawhide build => need to sync it and untag relevant overrides to get the latest builds
[  ] - gopkg.in spec file generator
[  ] - create fedora mailing list to register new golang packages
[  ] - bodhi --new --type newpackage --notes 'First package for Fedora' golang-github-vaughan0-go-ini-0-0.2.gita98ad7e.el6
[  ] - bodhi --new --release f21 --file bodhi.template golang-github-onsi-ginkgo-1.1.0-1.fc21 --username jchaloup
[  ] - make an online graph of golang deps and info about them (plus changelog of fedora packaging and known issues = cyclic deps, missing [Build]Requires, ...?)
[  ] - script to check which golang packages are stable, testing, not updated yet (el6 basically)
[  ] - write a scan of all golang packages for conflicting files (does any two packages install the same file?)
[  ] - add logger to gofed
[  ] - use gofed inspect to list all directories containing *.go files and make it a dep of all golang packages? What other things can gofed provide? List of provides, ...?
[  ] - when running bbo, untag all bbo before the current bbo
[  ] - if I run more gofed check-deps at the same time, will it collide?
[  ] - run apidiff for all commits of a given package (graph: y #+/-, x commits)
[  ] - gofed check-api URL: make an overview of changes of all symbols through out all commits
[  ] - finish inspectpackage.sh
[  ] - replace initPackageInRepo.sh with gofed wizard
[  ] - add locks (gofed scan-imports can modify local db, it is not good to run gofed scandeps or other commands)
[  ] - hourly scan of golang packages => create server for that
[  ] - write a script to get a list of all builds ready to be pushed to stable (7 days expired, ...)
[  ] - create a tool that for a given project creates a list of all dependencies (use go get to download all deps) => graph of deps
[  ] - for each project list all used symbols (with possible package membership). User will get a list of all possible symbols which will need manual inspection in some cases.
[  ] - use go get to retrieve all tarballs? universal spec generator?
[  ] - gofed ggi: if class unknown, add some hints how to handle it
[  ] - decompose project into subpackages
[  ] - daily check for broken import paths (just use gofed scan-deps errors/warnings) 
[  ] - if I update package will it be enougn for all tools (would be great to see what tools use what commits) => put Godeps.json files of tools to sources file so it can be downloaded easilly? Or when gofed scan-imports -c: create/update a local database of Godeps.json files for all tarballs that has it (add line to copy Godeps.json to %docs) + update Go packaging draft (again as optional)

====version-1====

====NOTCRITICAL====
[  ] - gofed apidiff libcontainer-1.2.0 libcontainer-1.4.0 -c: some messages still miss its location (is it parameter, is it type, ...)
[  ] - add to description of every package some information to be parsed by scripts, e.g. commit, upstream url, ...
[  ] - /tmp/test/etcd-2.0.3/client/http.go has interface in interface which is not present in exported symbols (type SyncableHTTPClient interface)
[  ] - bash completion for directory paths (some commands neeed it and the current bash completion does not complete it)
[  ] - error messages prefixed by Error
[  ] - take a look at convention of private and public methods|attributes
[  ] - create a subpackage of gofed to provide only inspect utilities (list of imports, list of directories providing go source codes, ...) and replace copying of directories in an %install section
[  ] - for a given package, list all its deps and for this deps, list all its deps, and so on {graph is not enough, only terminal output}
[  ] - api check: if a type is change to its super type, report it but without minus symbol "-" => upgrade the check and for a given type list all its supertypes as well (second walk through go symbols) {is there something like supertype in golang}
[  ] - sort all symbols in an alphabetical order before saving to xml file
[  ] - create a service file to run daily/hourly scans (updates of local pkgdb)
[  ] - script to check a structure of spec file of every golang package
[  ] - for each package in Godeps.json check if the given import path is provided, not just the package itself
[  ] - run all commands without internet connection (print no internet connection error, catch exception, gofed bump, gofed repo2spec --detect, ...)
[  ] - script to list all dependencies (recursivelly) for a given package {partially by gofed scandeps -g PKGNAME}

====TODO===
[  ] - DOC: godep check-deps is using data/golang.imap, which has to updated by gofed scan-imports
[  ] - DOC: write a short document about gofed tool (after renaming it to gofed). But just about the graph and what it tells about the system. Publish individual use case rather then the whole tool. Still young to make a version 1.
[  ] - DOC: when running gofed review, ssh-copy-key must be used (no password)
[  ] - update packaging draft for golang {once lint is finished (to some extent)}
[  ] - gofed repo2spec: add option to generate spec files for secondary architectures as well
[  ] - gofed lint on etcd: there is no tarball with shortcommit, only version => incorect list of superfluous provides
[  ] - add setup.py instead of manual install
[  ] - make 'gofet lint' skip directories specified via --skip-dirs and read them from gofed.conf
[  ] - update spec file generator for with_* macros and add option to generate implicit build section
[  ] - 'gofed scan-symbols' pridat optiony pro scanovani jen nektery souboru
[  ] - generate a graph of dependencies for actual state of dependencies for each day (For each project, for all projects, ...). Discuss if it is even possible, sane or reasonable
[  ] - 'gofed scan-imports -c' should create the latest xml file (including <imports>). Problem is a detection of import path prefix!!!. How can I detect/construct it and be sure it is the correct one (from golang.repos?)
[  ] - add --master option to tools as shortcut for --branches="master"
